# E-commerce-website-Django
This is my first Full stack web development of a ECommerce site using Django Framework, html , css and Javascript with sqlite database. I have added a cart system to add items to a cart, Checkout page which will display the final products added in the cart along with the total price of all the items in the cart and finally i have added the paytm API to transfer the user to the paytm payment page to pay for the purchased items
